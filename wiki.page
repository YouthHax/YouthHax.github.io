YouthHax is an organization that hosts an annual [[hackathon]], founded by Raymond Li in November 2018. Two hackathons have thus far been organized, in December 2018 and December 2019.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://youthhax.com/|title=YouthHax|website=youthhax.com|access-date=2020-01-25}}</ref> Both were [[Major League Hacking|Local hack Day]] events in [[Markham, Ontario]], run with the help of local volunteers, at [[Markham Public Library]] locations.<ref name=":0" /> A third event has been planned for 2020. As of January 2020, the only hackathons held in Markham have been YouthHax events.

== History ==

YouthHax originated when Raymond Li was unable to find any hackathons in the vicinity of Markham, the "high-tech capital" of [[Canada]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yorkregion.com/news-story/8994621-york-region-boasts-canada-s-highest-concentration-of-tech-firms-planner/|title=York Region boasts Canadaâ€™s highest concentration of tech firms: planner|last=Al-Shibeeb|first=Dina|date=2018-10-30|website=YorkRegion.com|language=en-CA|access-date=2020-01-25}}</ref> He committed to organizing his own to provide accessible, engaging hackathons to students in Markham. The idea caught on with Markham Public Library, which gave YouthHax the space it needed to host the first hackathon in Markham.

== Events ==

YouthHax events are annual; they have been named after their respective years.
